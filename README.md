# Hackathon-Marsh

The mission of our team is to shop insurance for small business using real-time data. Leveraging leading technology such as digital twins and IoT, our platform aims at using businesses’ data to advance the insurance recommendation system. Based on the clients’ profile, personal preference and real-time data such as GPS, machine sensors and images from security cameras, we will recommend long-term and on-demand insurances that best fit their individual needs. In addition, our platform would suggest joining Communities where businesses with similar demands could negotiate better insurance prices. We believe the future of business insurance is personalized real-time data recommendations to deliver a seamless customer experience.

We have also created a demo using R Shiny dashboard techniques.
